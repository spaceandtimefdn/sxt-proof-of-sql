# PoSQL SQL Syntax

Proof of SQL uses [sqlparser](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-sqlparser-rs) to parse SQL. It currently supports the following syntax. The syntax support is rapidly expanding, and we are happy to take suggestions about what should be added. Anyone submitting a PR must ensure that this is kept up to date.

[^1]: Currently, we do not support any string or binary operations beyond = and !=.
[^2]: Currently, we only support some inner joins on one column.
[^3]: Currently there are restrictions on aggregations we support.
[^4]: Currently, we only support decimals up to 75 digits of precision and inequality operators only operate on decimals up to 38 digits of precision.
[^5]: Currently, we support filters only on tables.
