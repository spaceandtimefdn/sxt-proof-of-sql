1. Are there any specific performance requirements for the conversions that need to be maintained?

2. Are there any specific requirements around error handling that need to be preserved?

3. Should we consider adding any additional time units in the future, and if so, should we design the structure to be more extensible?

4. Are there any specific requirements around serialization/deserialization that need to be maintained beyond the current serde implementation?

5. Are there any specific requirements around documentation that need to be maintained or improved?

6. Are there any specific requirements around testing beyond the current test coverage?

7. Should we consider adding any validation or constraints on the time unit values beyond what's currently implemented?
