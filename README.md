## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Linux x86_64
* [Rust 1.62.0](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### Installation

#### Using the Docker container:

If you have a Linux machine, a Docker installed, and a GPU available, run the following command:

```bash
bash ci/run_docker_with_gpu.sh
```

In case you don't have a GPU available, run:

```bash
bash ci/run_docker_with_cpu.sh
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Using the proofs Library in your project


### Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Benchmarks

The benchmark scripts test the execution time for proof generation and verification with multiple types of SQL queries. For each SQL query, we produce two types of benchmarks:

1) The plot benchmark, where we vary the number of table rows and then plot how execution increases as the number of rows also increase.
2) The callgrind benchmark, where we fix the number of table rows and then profile the code so that we can generate a callgrind SVG graph.

In order to be able to execute those benchmarks, you'll need python3 and valgrind installed. Use the following commands to accomplish the whole process.

```bash
# 1) install all the necessary ubuntu dependencies
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip valgrind graphviz

# 2) install all the necessary python dependencies
python3 -m pip install -r benches/provable_sql/scripts/requirements.txt

# 3) execute the benchmark suite
python3 benches/provable_sql/scripts/run_benches.py --generate-plots 1 --generate-callgrind 1 --open-html 1

# 4) for a complete list of parameters, use
python3 benches/provable_sql/scripts/run_benches.py -h
```

Our CircleCI workflow is already integrated with the above steps through the `bench` job, automatically generating summary tables about the execution and the benchmark data as CI artifacts. Note that those summary files generate benchmark data at every PR commit, which are compared against some reference benchmark, stored under `benches/provable_sql/data/`. Bear in mind that those reference data should be updated frequently so that any performance improvement
is compared against the most recent reference benchmark data. In order to easily update those reference benchmark files, please follow the next steps:

```bash
# Whenever you notice a significant improvement in the benchmark results,
# download the most recent benchmark data generated by the CI workflow, 
# named `tmp/benchmarks/all_benchmark_data.tgz` under the artifacts CircleCI tab.

# Then extract the above tgz files to the current repo folder.
tar -xzvf all_benchmark_data.tgz

# Finally copy the extracted files to the reference benchmark directory
# the old reference files should all be substituted by the most recent ones,
# which are expected to represent an improved version of the code.
cp -av target/benches/provable_sql/* benches/provable_sql/data/
```

Note that all the reference benchmarks are described in the `benches/provable_sql/data/statistics_benchmark_data.txt` text file. For instance, this file describes the number of table rows used with the callgrind plot benchmarks, the type of query applied, the path to the callgrind svg file generated, the execution time of each query proof creation and verification, etc. Bear in mind that if you consider changing any parameter in the python script that would deviate the execution from this reference data, for instance by changing the number of table columns used, then you must remove this text file, and then upload a new one after CI executes its `bench` job. If you do not remove the `benches/provable_sql/data/statistics_benchmark_data.txt` after updating the python script parameters, then the benchmark execution may fail.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

We are using semantic-release to automatically version our code. Alongside that, we adopted conventional commits to maintain our code history, which is used by semantic-release. Bear in mind that these two specify very precise rules that must be followed for the correct automatic release process. Please, check this [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Continuous Integration (CI)

To allow semantic-release to publish to our GitHub release, you need to set up the following GitHub token in the CircleCI settings:

- **GH_TOKEN**: some Github user token with write privileges to the proofs repository
