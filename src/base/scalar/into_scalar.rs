/// Provides conversion to [Scalar].
///
/// This conversion is especially important for proofs.
/// Any data type we want to support will need to be able to convert to Scalar.
/// So, this trait may be used as a bound for supported data types.
///
/// We could just use rust's [From] and [Into] traits.
/// However, some types we want to support are foreign, and since Scalar itself is foreign, we
/// won't be able to provide these conversions.
///
/// One solution would be to create a new-type around every foreign type we want to support.
/// The other is to provide a new conversion trait entirely.
///
/// The latter was chosen for two reasons:
/// 1. We can still create new-types if we want to, but we don't have to in simple cases.
/// 2. There may be already-existing conversions for Scalar on types we *don't* want to support.
/// A new trait allows us to be explicit about the types we want to support.
