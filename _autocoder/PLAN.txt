PLAN: Break down unit.rs into smaller, more focused files

1. Create directory structure [COMPLETED]
   - Created unit/ directory
   - Created unit/tests/ directory

2. Create core types module (types.rs) [COMPLETED]
   - Moved PoSQLTimeUnit enum definition
   - Moved derive attributes
   - Kept documentation

3. Create conversions module (conversions.rs) [COMPLETED]
   - Moved From<PoSQLTimeUnit> for u64 implementation
   - Moved TryFrom<&str> for PoSQLTimeUnit implementation
   - Kept error handling

4. Create display module (display.rs) [COMPLETED]
   - Moved Display implementation for PoSQLTimeUnit
   - Kept formatting logic

5. Create tests module (tests/unit_tests.rs) [COMPLETED]
   - Moved all test functions
   - Moved test utilities and imports
   - Kept test organization

6. Create mod.rs [COMPLETED]
   - Added module declarations
   - Re-exported types and traits
   - Maintained public API
   - Fixed test module path with #[path] attribute
   - Added missing documentation for unit module

7. Cleanup and verification [COMPLETED]
   - Removed old unit.rs
   - Verified all files are in place
   - Fixed module visibility in posql_time/mod.rs
   - All tests passing in proof-of-sql-parser crate

STATUS: All tasks completed successfully. The unit.rs file has been successfully broken down into smaller, more focused files while maintaining all functionality and test coverage.

NOTES:
- Had to adjust test module configuration to properly locate test files
- Added missing documentation for the unit module to fix compiler warning
- Changed unit module visibility to public in posql_time/mod.rs
- Some test failures in the proof-of-sql crate are unrelated to our changes (GPU-related)
