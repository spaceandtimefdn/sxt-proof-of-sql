Project Analysis Notes:

1. Project Type:
- This is a Rust project (evidenced by Cargo.toml files and .rs source files)
- Uses a workspace structure with multiple crates:
  - proof-of-sql-parser
  - proof-of-sql
- Also contains Solidity smart contracts that are tested with Foundry

2. Build System:
- Uses Cargo (Rust's package manager and build tool)
- Has a rust-toolchain.toml file indicating specific Rust version requirements
- Build commands from CI:
  - cargo check (various feature combinations)
  - cargo build (implicit in cargo test)
- Dependencies required:
  - clang
  - lld

3. Testing:
- Uses cargo test
- Commands from CI:
  - cargo test --all-features (main test command)
  - cargo test --no-default-features --features="arrow blitzar" (without rayon)
  - Also runs various examples as integration tests
- Also has Solidity tests:
  - Uses Foundry/forge for testing
  - forge test --root=crates/proof-of-sql --summary --detailed

4. Linting:
- Uses multiple linters:
  - Clippy (Rust linter):
    - Command: cargo clippy -- -D warnings
  - Rustfmt (Rust formatter):
    - Command: cargo fmt --check
  - Solhint (Solidity linter):
    - Command: solhint -c 'crates/proof-of-sql/.solhint.json' 'crates/proof-of-sql/**/*.sol' -w 0

5. Dependencies needed in container:
- From CI file:
  - clang
  - lld
- For Solidity:
  - nodejs/npm (for solhint)
  - foundry-rs toolchain
- Rust toolchain
